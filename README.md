LET'S GO GAMBLING!!

created for hack club siege

WASD to move, space to do stuff

on controller, Left Stick to move and A to do stuff (it'll still say to press Space unless I fix that after writing this)

you can actually time the slots to win consistently. the goal is to fill the money room with enough money to get to the door

made using Godot, Blender, and paint.net
